Hi, I'm @djanfelipe, a 27 years old brazilian test automator :nerd_face:.

My goal here is to share the knowledge I'm acquiring through my carreer :books:.

The topics I'll try to cover here are:
- Testing frameworks :hammer_and_wrench:;
- Front-end basics :computer:;
- Some scripting languages codes :scroll:;
- Continuous Integration and others DevOps techniques :gear:; 

And that's it! I hope you all enjoy this profile.
